Hello Hello Devendra Nimbodkar is speaking from the training center you love in Tata Development Programs and you have registered your name.
Where to start because I have little knowledge of me or you are going to do it in the taluka.
There are electrical electrics in which they are Bihar. Who will be your customers who are the whole farmer and then if you are going to start this business, you have studied it or not.
Because of that, some of the motors that he calls him to repair that the repair has come to me in a small scale and I can do well. I have also studied for this and I have taken motor training well. Well, it is fine. So now the motor feeding is said to be repairs and repair is said to be how the material that is a material that has gone. OK for this I just need to be a huge amount of it. So it is important that the copper wire is then a type of wireless one is to be tied to it.
If the information is Marathwada, what is your way to you
For the first time, I have seen it online in the context of Mahesh, but I have told me my friend has told me that if this is your business, then there is any competition in this business, there is a large number of competition in your area because the farmer said that the motor was more.
And how do you have your conversation? If you have a close closure, if you have to return to you or the password you have to go, what is lacking in what you have to do is to do it overall.
If you are doing this, if you call it monthly income, then you will generally get the income of Nashik and now about the business of the business.
From month to month, whatever our revenue grows, from 7 to 70 thousand, only 40 to 45 thousand, I have learned a brief information about your business. Thank you so mach
