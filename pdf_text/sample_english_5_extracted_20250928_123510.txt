*   **Estimated Cost of Business Setup (A):** Rs. 410,000
*   **Your Investment (B):** Rs. 210,000
*   **Deficit Amount (C = A - B):** Rs. 10,000 (This calculation is incorrect based on A-B, likely an OCR error or miscalculation in original. 410,000 - 210,000 = 200,000. However, the text explicitly states "Rupees 10000" in the box for C. I will keep the explicit value.)
*   **Loan Requirement for Business Setup Phase (First Month) (D = C):** Rs. 10,000

### Price - Business Sustenance Phase (2-7 Months)

*   **First Loan requirement for business sustenance phase (2-7 months) (I = F * 6):** Rupees 90,000 (Based on Expected profit F=15000, 15000 * 6 = 90000)
*   **Expected profit at the end of business sustenance phase (F * 6):** Rupees 90,000

---

### Price - Business Expansion Phase (8-12 Months)

*   **Hiring of Employees**

*   **Desired profit amount per month (Set Realistic and Achievable Goal) (K):** Rupees 17,000
*   **Expected Total Value of Sales per month (L = J + K):** Rupees 50,200 (Calculation: 33200 + 17000 = 50200. The text says "1450200 Rupees" but that's unlikely given the monthly fixed cost and desired profit. Assuming "14" is a stray OCR, it should be "50200".)
*   **Target sales of products/services to be achieved per day (M = L / 30):** Rupees 1,674 (Calculation: 50200 / 30 = 1673.33)
